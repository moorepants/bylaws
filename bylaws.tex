This Section~\ref{sec:actionsBrought} applies to any proceeding other than an
action ``by or on behalf of the corporation'' as defined in
Section~\ref{sec:actionBrought}.  Such proceedings that are not brought by or
on behalf of the Corporation are referred to in this
Section~\ref{sec:actionsBrought} as ``Third Party proceedings.''
\subsubsection{Scope of Indemnification in Third Party Proceedings}
\label{sec:scopeIndemnificationThird}
Subject to the required findings to be made pursuant to
Section~\ref{sec:requiredStandard}, the Corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any Third Party proceeding, by reason of the fact that such person is or was an Agent, for all expenses, judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the proceeding. 
\subsubsection{Required Standard of Conduct For Indemnification in Third Party Proceedings}
\label{sec:requiredStandard}
Any indemnification granted to an Agent in
Section~\ref{sec:scopeIndemnificationThird} above is conditioned on the following. 
The Ministry must determine, in the manner provided in
Section~\ref{sec:determinationAgent}, that the Agent seeking reimbursement acted in good faith, in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in the best interest of the Corporation, and, in the case of a criminal proceeding, he or she must have had no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.  The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or on a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith or in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in the best interest of the Corporation or that he or she had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
\subsection{Action Brought By or On Behalf Of the Corporation}
\label{sec:actionBrought}
This Section~\ref{sec:actionBrought} applies to any proceeding brought (1) by
or in the right of the Corporation, or (2) by an Minister, Officer, Director or
person granted relator status by the Attorney General, or by the Attorney
General, on the ground that the defendant Director was or is engaging in
self-dealing within the meaning of section 5233 of the California Nonprofit
Corporation Law, or (3) by the Attorney General or person granted relator status by the Attorney General for any breach of duty relating to assets held in charitable trust (any such proceeding is referred to in these Bylaws as a proceeding “by or on behalf of the Corporation”). 
\subsubsection{Scope of Indemnification in Proceeding By or On Behalf Of the Corporation}
\label{sec:scopeIndemnificationProceeding}
Subject to the required findings to be made pursuant to
Section~\ref{sec:requiredStandardBy}, and except as provided in
Sections~\ref{sec:claimsSettled} and \ref{sec:claimsSuits}, the Corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any proceeding by or on behalf of the Corporation, by reason of the fact that such person is or was an Agent, for all expenses actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of such action. 
\subsubsection{Required Standard of Conduct For Indemnification in Proceeding By or On Behalf Of the Corporation}
\label{sec:requiredStandardBy}
Any indemnification granted to an Agent in
Section~\ref{sec:scopeIndemnificationProceeding} or \ref{sec:claimsSettled} is conditioned on the following. The Ministry must determine, in the manner provided in Section 11.5, that the Agent seeking reimbursement acted in good faith, in a manner he or she believed to be in the best interest of the Corporation and with such care, including reasonable inquiry, as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. 
\subsubsection{Claims Settled Out of Court}
\label{sec:claimsSettled}
If any Agent settles or otherwise disposes of a threatened or pending action
brought by or on behalf of the Corporation, with or without court approval, the
Agent may receive indemnification for amounts paid pursuant to the terms of the
settlement or other disposition pursuant to the same conditions specified in
Section~\ref{sec:requiredStandard} or with approval of the Attorney General. 
\subsubsection{Claims and Suits Awarded Against Agent}
\label{sec:claimsSuits}
If any Agent is adjudged to be liable to the Corporation in the performance of
the Agent's duty to the Corporation, the Agent shall receive no indemnification
for amounts paid pursuant to the judgment, and any indemnification of such
Agent under Section~\ref{sec:scopeIndemnificationProceeding} for expenses actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the defense of that action shall be made only if both of the following conditions are met:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(1)] The determination of good faith conduct required by
        Section~\ref{sec:requiredStandardBy} must be made in the manner provided
        for in Section~\ref{sec:determinationAgent}; and
    \item[(2)] Upon application, the court in which the action was brought must
        determine whether, in view of all of the circumstances of the case, the
        Agent is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for the expenses
        incurred. If the Agent is found to be so entitled, the court shall
        determine the appropriate amount of expenses to be reimbursed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Determination of Agent's Good Faith Conduct}
\label{sec:determinationAgent}
The indemnification granted to an Agent in Section~\ref{sec:actionsBrought} and Section~\ref{sec:actionBrought} is conditioned on the findings required by those Sections being made by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(1)] the Ministry by a consensus vote; or
    \item[(2)] the court in which the proceeding is or was pending.  Such determination may be made on application brought by the Corporation or the Agent or the attorney or other person rendering a defense to the Agent, whether or not the application by the Agent, attorney, or other person is opposed by the Corporation.
\end{itemize} 
\subsection{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations2}
No indemnification or advance shall be made under this
Article~\ref{sec:indemnificationDirectors}, except as provided in
Sections~\ref{sec:successfulDefense} or \ref{sec:claimsSuits}(b), in any circumstances when it appears:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(1)] that the indemnification of advance would be inconsistent with a
        provision of the Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or an agreement
        in effect at the time of the accrual of the alleged cause of action
        asserted in the proceeding in which the expenses were incurred or other
        amounts were paid, which prohibits or otherwise limits indemnification;
        or
    \item[(2)] that the indemnification would be inconsistent with any condition
        expressley imposed by a court in approving a settlement.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Advance of Expenses}
\label{sec:advanceExpenses}
Expenses incurred in defending any proceeding may be advanced by the
Corporation before the final disposition of the proceeding on receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of the Agent to repay the amount of the advance
unless it is determined ultimately that the Agent is entitled to be indemnified
as authorized in this Article~\ref{sec:indemnificationDirectors}. Also, in cases settled or otherwise disposed of without court approval, the Agent shall receive no indemnification for expenses reasonably incurred in defending against the proceeding, unless the proceeding is settled with the approval of the Attorney General.
\subsection{Contractual Rights of Non-Directors and Non-Officers}
\label{sec:contractualRights}
Nothing contained in this Article~\ref{sec:indemnificationDirectors} shall affect any right to indemnification for persons other than Agents of the Corporation, or any of its subsidiaries, unless entitled by contract or otherwise.
\subsection{Insurance}
\label{sec:insurance}
The Ministry may adopt a resolution authorizing the purchase and maintenance of
insurance on behalf of any Agent, as defined in this
Article~\ref{sec:indemnificationDirectors}, against any liability asserted against
or incurred by any Agent in such capacity or arising out of the Agent's status
as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify the
Agent against the liability under the provisions of this
Article~\ref{sec:indemnificationDirectors}.
